# Module

**Modules are not a built in Kirby feature.**

To make use of modules you first need to successfully install the  [Modules plugin](https://github.com/getkirby-plugins/modules-plugin).

## File structure

To make a module work, you need these files:

**Inside `bricks/gallery`:**

```text
gallery.html.php
gallery.yml
```

- `gallery.html.php` needs to match the brick folder name.
- `gallery.yml` needs to match the brick folder name.

Read more about modules on the [Modules docs](https://github.com/getkirby-plugins/modules-plugin).
