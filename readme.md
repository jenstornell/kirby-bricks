## Installation

Use one of the alternatives below.

### 1. Kirby CLI

If you are using the [Kirby CLI](https://github.com/getkirby/cli) you can install this plugin by running the following commands in your shell:

```
$ cd path/to/kirby
$ kirby plugin:install jenstornell/kirby-bricks
```

### 2. Clone or download

1. [Clone](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-bricks.git) or [download](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-bricks/archive/master.zip)  this repository.
2. Unzip the archive if needed and rename the folder to `kirby-bricks`.

**Docs**

- https://getkirby.com/docs/templates/snippets
- https://getkirby.com/docs/templates/hello-world
- https://getkirby.com/docs/panel/blueprints
- https://getkirby.com/docs/developer-guide/advanced/controllers

I will use `about` as template in examples in the next steps.

### 6. Load custom files

With every brick a root file will be loaded if it exists. From that file you can include additional files that is not encounted for.

From within that file you can include or register set whatever you want.

## Options

The following option can be set in your `/site/config/config.php` file:

```php
c::set('plugin.bricks.register', array(
  'blueprint',
  'controller',
  'snippet',
  'template',
));
```

### register

If you are concerned about speed and don't want the plugin to look for all the files and folders you can use this option to only select which types to include.

By default everything above is included.

## Common errors

If you get out of memory it probably depends that Kirby can't find a template. Make sure you have a template that is loaded correctly.
